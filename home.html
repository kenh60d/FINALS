            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>Sharks came in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and even colors. Sharks are found from shallow to deep sea environments the world over. Great White Sharks are rare because being hunted by man for fins and teeth often as a trophy for sport fishing. Researchers believe that rather than preying on humans to eat the, the sharks are instead taking a "sample bite"out of curiosity before the swimming off. </p>
